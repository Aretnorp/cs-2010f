TEST PLAN

1. Compile the program

    Expected Result:
        The program runs!

    Actual Result:
        The program runs!

2. Run the application with no arguments

    Expected Result:
        The program creates the files automatically in the local
        directory.

    Actual Result:
        The program creates the files "calendar", "announcements"
        and "login" in the local directory.

3. Run the application with a single argument "thom0731"

    Expected Result:

        directory.

    Actual Result:
        The program creates the required files from the previous
        step in the directory.

4. Run the application with the files pre-existing, and ensure that
   the files are not automatically overwritten

    Expected Result:
        The program reads the current files and uses them. It only
        overwrites them if the data on BlackBoard is different.

    Actual Result:
        The program reads the current files and uses them. It only
        overwrites them if the data on BlackBoard is different.

5. Run the application with the files either pre-existing or
   have them created at run-time. Login to BlackBoard using your
   internet browser of choice. Create an event on the calendar.

    Expected Result:
        The program detects the change in the Calendar. It updates
        the running file and adds the changes.
